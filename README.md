cpp-testing-ground
====================

A bunch of C++ programs for testing ideas and experimenting with C++ features.

Building instructions
-----------------------

These are <b>experimental</b> code for testing compiler features and random ideas. So, some of them will not compile or will <b>crash</b> your system! You've been warned!

Windows: There is a Visual Studio solution file (.sln). Open it and build (you might want to build only individual projects and not the entire solution).


Coding style
-------------

Every project/directory here has its own coding style. It's because I work in different development
teams, each with its own coding styles and gudelines. When I write code, I try to stick to
the style of my current team.
